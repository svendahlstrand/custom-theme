00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.400
So this right here, it's a 24 year old digital video camera.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.640
And I just want to show you how ridiculous my setup is to get this hooked up to my Mac, my modern Mac.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.020
Let's start with this old FireWire cable.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.600
It goes into one adapter, a FireWire to a Thunderbolt adapter.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.960
Which in turn goes into another adapter, a Thunderbolt version 2 to version 3 adapter.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.280
Which finally goes into the MacBook Air.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.360
And here's the live feed directly from the camera.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.740
And here's a Christmas tree.
